# How Comuters Work

The word computer refers to an object that can accept some input and produce some output. In fact, the human brain itself is a sophisticated computer, and scientists are learning more about how it works with each passing year. Our most common use of the word computer, though, is to describe an electronic device containing a microprocessor.

## microprocessor: 
is a small electronic device that can carry out complex calculations in the blink of an eye. You can find microprocessors in many devices you use each day, such as cars, refrigerators and televisions. The most recognized device with a microprocessor is the personal computer, or PC. In fact, the concept of a computer has become nearly synonymous with the term PC.

When you hear PC, you probably envision an enclosed device with an attached video screen, keyboard and some type of a pointing device, like a mouse or touchpad. You might also envision different forms of PCs, such as desktop computers, towers and laptops. The term PC has been associated with certain brands, such as Intel processors or Microsoft operating systems. In this article, though, we define a PC as a more general computing device with these characteristics:

+ designed for use by one person at a time.
+ runs an operating system to interface between the user and the microprocessor.
+ has certain common internal components described in this article, like a CPU and RAM .
+ runs software applications designed for specific work or play activities.
+ allows for adding and removing hardware or software as needed.
