# HTML


It is important that your web designer start off by asking a lot of questions to help them understand your business and your needs in a web site.

Certain things to consider are:

* Purpose
What is the purpose of the site? Do you want to provide information, promote a service, sell a product?
* Goals
What do you hope to accomplish by building this web site? Two of the more common goals are either to make money or share information.
* Target Audience
Is there a specific group of people that will help you reach your goals? It is helpful to picture the “ideal” person you want to visit your web site. Consider their age, sex or interests – this will later help determine the best design style for your site.
* Content
What kind of information will the target audience be looking for on your site? Are they looking for specific information, a particular product or service, online orderin?

## HTML Layout Elements

HTML offers several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:

+ header - Defines a header for a document or a section
+ nav - Defines a container for navigation links
+ section - Defines a section in a document
+ article - Defines an independent self-contained article
+ aside - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
+ footer - Defines a footer for a document or a section
+ details - Defines additional details
+ summary - Defines a heading for the element


## Article

The article tag specifies independent, self-contained content.
An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site.
