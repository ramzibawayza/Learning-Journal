# JAVASCRIPT

## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task

## Create one?
There are different ways to create new objects:

Define and create a single object, using an object literal.
Define and create a single object, with the keyword new.
Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type.
