### growth mindset
In decision theory and general systems theory, a mindset is a set of assumptions, methods, or notations held by one or more people or groups of people.[citation needed]

A mindset can also be seen as incident of a person's world view or philosophy of life.[citation needed]

A mindset may be so firmly established that it creates a powerful incentive within these people or groups to continue to adopt or accept prior behaviors, choices, or tools.[citation needed] The latter phenomenon is also sometimes described as mental inertia, "groupthink", and it is often difficult to counteract its effects upon analysis and decision making processes.
