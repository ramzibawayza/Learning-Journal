## Git 

Git is one of those tools that is so simple to use, that you often don’t learn a lot of nuance to it. You wind up cloning a repository from the Internet and that’s about it.

In 2005, the relationship between the community that developed the Linux kernel and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper broke down, and the tool’s free-of-charge status was revoked. This prompted the Linux development community (and in particular Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux) to develop their own tool based on some of the lessons they learned while using BitKeeper. Some of the goals of the new system were as follows:

Speed
Simple design
Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)
Fully distributed
Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)

finally, we need install this program, and enter Your Identity and your Program that will work on it, and go to:
